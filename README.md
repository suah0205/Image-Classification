# Image-Classification
Image Classification using Keras on CIFAR-10 dataset

Image classification is a fascinating deep learning project. Specifically, image classification comes under the computer vision project category.
In this project, we will build a convolution neural network in Keras with python on a CIFAR-10 dataset. First, we will explore our dataset, and then we will train our neural network using python and Keras.

# What is Image Classification
 - The classification problem is to categorize all the pixels of a digital image into one of the defined classes.
 - Image classification is the most critical use case in digital image analysis.
 - Image classification is an application of both supervised classification and unsupervised classification.
   - In supervised classification, we select samples for each target class. We train our neural      network on these target class samples and then classify new samples.
   - In unsupervised classification, we group the sample images into clusters of images having similar properties. Then, we classify each cluster into our intended classes.
